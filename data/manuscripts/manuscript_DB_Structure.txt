Manuscript Document Collection Structure 
Each manuscripts is connected to ONLY ONE manuscript_history_Object (idek if this is possible )

We update manuscript_history_Object every time the AUTHOR publishes any changes -- so basically every time an UPDATE happens. Then, we give MANUSCRIPT a clean, new manuscript_test_object and we copy the old manuscript_text_Object into this schema. We link the history back to the manuscript with a unique id 

So it’s also possible for us to normalize the schema below into multiple collections, but I heard that in mongodb you should have shit in collections unless absolutely necessary, bs the whole concept of mongodb is to have the related thing bundled up in one “JSON-LIKE” object so that “fetch-ing” information (READ operations) are quick and easy. But also! Each collection has a max limits of 16 MB (i think) so the document can’t grow toooo long. If need be, we might make “versions” it’s own entity 

This whole nesting thing is so ugly 😫 but look! I made it color coded and all pretty :)
